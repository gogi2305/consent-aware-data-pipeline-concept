# System Overview

This document describes a high-level conceptual pipeline.

## Conceptual Flow

1. User provides data voluntarily
2. Explicit consent is captured and scoped
3. Public signals are processed within defined limits
4. Findings are explained with provenance
5. System stops before decision-making

## Key Design Choice

The system does **not**:
- infer intent,
- assess trustworthiness,
- produce recommendations about people.

It only structures information and its explanation.
