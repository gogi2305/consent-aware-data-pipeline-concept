# Trust Boundaries

This project is intentionally defined by its limits.

## Explicitly excluded data
- Government-issued identifiers
- Private or leaked databases
- Non-public social profiles
- Purchased enrichment data

## Where automation stops
- Identity matching is probabilistic and never final
- Conflicting signals are not resolved automatically
- Any sensitive finding requires human review

## Prohibited outputs
- No scoring of individuals
- No recommendations ("hire / do not hire")
- No behavioral or psychological profiling

## Responsibility model
The system provides structured signals and explanations.
All interpretation and decisions remain with humans.
